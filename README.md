# A Comparative Study of Unity DOTS/ECS and Object-Oriented Programming in Mobile Game Development Platforms

This repository contains the code developed as part of the research conducted for the Master's Thesis titled "A Comparative Study of Unity DOTS/ECS and Object-Oriented Programming in Mobile Game Development Platforms" by Anh Nguyen Hoang. The thesis was completed in April 2024 as part of the Degree Programme in Computer Science and Engineering.

## Abstract

This study conducts a comparative analysis between Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data-Oriented Programming (DOP) paradigms in the context of mobile game development using the Unity Engine. Through practical implementation and performance testing of a game called "Ant Pheromones," the research investigates the efficiency and effectiveness of each programming approach. The study employs Unity Profiler and AMD uProf tools to evaluate key metrics such as overall performance, cache utilization, battery usage, memory allocation, and parallelization. Findings reveal that DOP, particularly through the Entity Component System (ECS), demonstrates superior performance in handling large datasets and complex simulations, with better cache utilization and lower energy consumption compared to OOP. However, challenges such as a steeper learning curve and limited support for certain features are noted with ECS implementation. While the study provides valuable insights into programming paradigms for mobile game development, its scope is confined to Unity Engine and may not be universally applicable. Future research could explore broader industry contexts and alternative game engines to enhance understanding and applicability. Overall, this study aims to contribute to informed decision-making in mobile game development practices, offering insights into optimizing resource usage and enhancing game performance.

## Introduction

This repository hosts the codebase used in conducting experiments, analyzing data, and implementing algorithms discussed in the thesis. The research focuses on comparing the efficiency and effectiveness of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data-Oriented Programming (DOP) paradigms in mobile game development platforms, specifically using the Unity Engine.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Unity Engine v2022.2.21f or above.
- Git

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nguyenhoanganh194/Anh-Nguyen-master-thesis.git
```

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Unity Hub installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [Unity website](https://unity.com/).

2. Open Unity Hub and click on the "Projects" tab.

3. Click on the "Add" button and navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository.

4. Select the root folder of the Unity project and click "Open."

5. Unity Hub will now recognize the project. Click on it to open the project in the Unity Editor.

6. Once the project is open in the Unity Editor, you can proceed with running and modifying the project as described in the [Usage](#usage) section.

## Usage

To use the code, follow these steps:

1. Open the Unity project in the Unity Editor.

2. Open the scene named "Preloader."

3. Run the scene to initialize the game.

4. If desired, navigate to the "DOP Simulation" or "OOP Simulation" scene in the Unity Editor to explore simulations using Data-Oriented Programming (DOP) or Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigms, respectively.

5. Modify configurations or parameters as needed in the respective scenes.

6. Run the scenes to observe the simulations and analyze performance metrics.

7. Experiment with different settings and configurations to further understand the differences between DOP and OOP approaches. You can do this directly in the Unity Editor or build the project and run it on any device for real-world testing.
